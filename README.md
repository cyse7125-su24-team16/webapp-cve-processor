### Building Application

#### Download and Process CVE Data: 
The application downloads the CVE list and processes all JSON files found in the directories. It utilizes the CVE Record Format to normalize and enrich how CVE information is presented, including severity scores, researcher credits, affected product lists, references, and community contribution capabilities.

#### Storage in PostgreSQL: 
CVEs are stored in a PostgreSQL database using the JSON data type. Proper indexing has been implemented on the JSON data type column for efficient querying.

#### Versioning of CVEs: 
The database model supports versioning of CVEs to accommodate updates after initial publication. This enables the application to query and retrieve all versions or updates of a CVE. Information such as assigner organization ID, assigner short name, CVE ID, publication date, reservation date, update date, and publication state is stored for each CVE.

#### Handling Duplicates: 
The application effectively handles duplicate CVE records, ensuring data integrity and reliability throughout the processing pipeline.

#### Completion Criteria: 
The application concludes its execution once all CVE records have been successfully processed and stored in the database.
